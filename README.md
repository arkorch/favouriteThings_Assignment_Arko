# Assignment Description

Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. Create a JSON object that contains at least 4 properties (name, description, etc) - you must include an image of some kind.

Use the class authoring files as a reference - however DO NOT use the design files - make something better. The three “things” should be represented by an interactive control on the page (button, image, etc) - when the user engages with the control, show more data about that “thing”.

The controls must use the JSON object as their data source - use the Fetch API to retrieve the object on page load and immediately update the view.

# Assignment Requirements

Design a mobile-first one page web application that highlights your favourite things. Use images, video, 3D - anything at all. You must use a JSON object with at least 4 properties - you MUST have title / heading (text), image(s) and descriptive text.

Include a landing / splash page with some controls to showcase each of your favourite things. You should also include some kind of error handling if things go awry.

Use an event and Fetch call to retrieve information specific to a favourite thing, and show that information in a lightbox or something similar.

Use modern tools and techniques to generate the required assets. Use SASS components for your CSS and JS components where appropriate.
